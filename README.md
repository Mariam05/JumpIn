 ### DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT VERSION
 This is currently a text-based implementation of the Jump-In puzzle game by Smart Games.
 In addition to this source code, you will also find the UML diagram, the design decisions made, and an executable .jar file submitted. 
 
 ### NEXT STEPS
 The next step after this is to implement a GUI based version of this game. We will also create unit tests for the Model class of the GUI.
